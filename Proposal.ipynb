    "During the early portion of the 2017 major league baseball season (28 May - 21 September 2017), the Houston Astros began a sign stealing campaign against other teams in the league. Alex Cora, then the Astros bench coach, began calling up to the media office in order to gain information on the opposing teams pitch signals presented by the catcher. This expanded into an operation of live-streaming the center field camera to the Astros dugout in order to decode signals throughout the majority of the season. This methodical progression led the Houston Astros to their first World Series championship in franchise history\n",
    "\n",
    "The practice of sign stealing within professional sports established the Astros in history and later the unethical behavior came to light when information was leaked by current and former players during the Fall of 2019. This information expanded into one of the largest scandals in major league baseball history and has since caused disruption amongst players throughout the league. There have been initial [analyses performed](http://signstealingscandal.com/statistical-analysis/), but this project will delve further into the team and player statistics in order to prove that this campaign made an impact on the 2017 season. Additionally, we hypothesize that we will see evidence of cheating in seasons following 2017. This study could improve the timeline and further pin down the extent of this scandal."

The second dataset will contain the team and player statistics for our comparisons. Specific statistics that will be used:\n",

    "Professional athletes are recognized for their determination and ability to achieve the upper echelon status of athletics. Introducing scandalous practices, such as sign stealing, only removes the pure ability that allows most to succeed at this level. Seeing as how the use of performance enhancing drugs is an illegal practice within major league baseball, how does a sign stealing campaign not withstand the same repercussions? This has been a fundamental question throughout the scandal period."

    "We will first use visualization practices in order to compare the Astrosâ€™ seasonal statistics against previous and following seasons to obtain a baseline performance of the team. Following this, we will compare additional teams to our initial findings, but more specifically, teams that finished at the top of their respective divisions. This process will be performed on the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Boston Red Sox, the Cleveland Indians, and the Washington Nationals. Doing this will give us a comparative model that we predict will show the enhanced performance of the Astros during their sign stealing campaign. Following this, we will further analyze the Astros to see if there were differences in batting statistics between home games, where their campaign was most prevalent, and away games. Furthermore, we will investigate the individual players to see if offensive statistical spikes were present and compare these results with previous and following seasons."
